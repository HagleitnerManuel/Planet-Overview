            <p>Mercury is the first and innermost planet in the solar system.
                Its distance to the sun is about 60,000,000 km, which means that
                the sun's light takes about three minutes to reach Mercury.
                Because of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is difficult to see with a telescope.
                Mercury revolves around the sun once in 88 days, four times as fast as Earth.
                It takes 176 days for Mercury to complete one complete rotation.
                The nearest neighboring planet is Venus, which is between 77 and 221 million
                kilometers away, depending on the orbit. Neither moons nor planetary rings orbit Mercury.
                Since Mercury is almost vertical in its orbital plane, there are no seasons.
                The direction of rotation is orthogonal. As a rocky planet, Mercury
                has a mass of 3.301 ⋅ 10^23 kg, which is only 0.05 the mass of Earth.
                Nevertheless, due to its nature, Mercury is one of the earth-like planets in our solar system.
                Its atmosphere consists mainly of the chemical elements oxygen, sodium, hydrogen and helium.
                The most common elements on the surface are silicon, iron and nickel.
                The inside consists of an iron-nickel core. With a total area of ​​74,800,000 km², it is about
                three times the size of Russia and China. At 3.7m/s², gravity is significantly weaker than on our earth.
                The average surface temperature is 170°C. However, temperatures can vary enormously depending on
                which side of the planet faces the sun. At night the temperature cools down to -170°C, while during the day
                more than +425°C can be reached. This means that Mercury has the greatest temperature fluctuations of all the
                planets in the solar system. At 4.5 billion years old, Mercury and Earth formed at about the same time.

                Venus is the second planet in the solar system. Its distance to the sun is
                about 110,000,000 km, which means that the sun's light takes about six minutes to reach Venus.
                After the moon, Venus is the brightest star in the starry sky and can therefore be easily observed with a telescope.
                On favorable days, Venus can even be seen with the naked eye. Venus revolves around
                the sun once in 243 days, which is about 100 days less than Earth needs for its year.
                It takes 116 days for Venus to complete one complete rotation. The nearest neighboring planet is Mercury,
                which is between 77 and 221 million kilometers away, depending on the orbit. Nevertheless,
                Venus is the planet that comes closest to Earth in its orbit. Neither moons nor planetary rings orbit Venus.
                Since Venus is practically not tilted in its orbital plane, there are no seasons.
                The direction of rotation is retrograde. As a rocky planet, Venus has a mass of 4.869 ⋅ 10^24 kg,
                which is 0.86 times the mass of Earth. Nevertheless, Venus is one of the earth-like planets in our
                solar system due to its composition. Your atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide.
                As the only rocky planet in the solar system, the atmosphere is permanently opaque.
                The exact composition of the chemical elements on the surface are unknown.
                The interior probably consists of an iron-nickel core. With a total area of ​​460,234,317 km²,
                it is roughly the size of Earth. At 8.87 m/s², gravity is also comparable to that of our earth.
                The average surface temperature is 470°C. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the
                year and vary between +430°C and +500°C. This rules out liquid water on Venus. With an age of 4.5 billion years,
                Venus and Earth formed at about the same time

                Earth is the third planet in the solar system. Its distance from the sun is about 150,000,000 km,
                which means that the sun's light takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach us.
                The earth revolves around the sun once in 365.2 days. It takes 24 hours for the earth to 
                rotate completely around its axis of rotation. With a mean orbital velocity of 29.78 km/s,
                Earth is moving faster than Mars but slower than Mercury and Venus. The closest neighboring planets
                are Venus and Mars, the latter being between 56 and 401 million kilometers away, depending on the orbit.
                The moon orbits the earth as the only natural satellite at a distance of about 380,000 km and
                stabilizes the planet through its gravitation in its inclination to the earth's axis. On the other hand,
                there is no planetary ring. Because of its orbital plane inclined at 23.5° to the sun, there are seasons on earth.
                The direction of rotation is orthogonal. As a rocky planet, Earth has a mass of 5.97 ⋅ 10^24kg.
                Their atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The most common chemical elements on the surface are iron,
                oxygen and silicon. The interior consists of an iron-nickel core with an estimated maximum temperature of 5000°C.
                The earth is surrounded by a magnetic field with a strength of 25 to 65 microtesla, which protects its inhabitants
                from solar winds. With a total area of ​​510,000,000 km² and a diameter of 12742 km, the earth is about the size of Venus.
                Gravity is 9.8 m/s². The average surface temperature is 15°C. The temperatures measured to date vary
                between -89°C and +58°C. Earth is still the only known planet in the solar system and beyond on which life forms have
                been detected. The age of the earth is estimated at 4.6 billion years.

                Mars is the fourth planet in the solar system. Its distance from the sun is approximately 227.9 million km,
                so it takes about thirteen minutes for sunlight to reach Mars. After Venus and Jupiter,
                Mars is the third-brightest planet in the sky and can be easily observed with a telescope and, on clear nights,
                even with the naked eye due to its red appearance. Mars takes 687 days to orbit the sun, almost twice as long as Earth.
                It takes about 24 hours for Mars to complete one rotation on its axis. One day on Mars therefore lasts as
                long as one on Earth. Mars's neighboring planets are Earth and Jupiter, with the former ranging from 56 to
                401 million kilometers away, depending on its orbit. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, but no planet rings.
                Like Earth, Mars stands in its orbital plane, so there are seasons. Its direction of rotation is prograde.
                As a rocky planet, Mars has a mass of 6.419 × 10^23 kg, which is 0.1 times the mass of Earth. Despite this,
                Mars is classified as an Earth-like planet due to its characteristics. Its atmosphere consists of 96% carbon dioxide,
                2% nitrogen, and 2% argon. The most common chemical elements on the surface are iron, sulfur, and silicon.
                The interior consists of an iron core with an estimated maximum temperature of 2000°C. With a total surface
                area of 144.798.500 km², Mars is about eight times the size of Russia. The gravity is significantly less attractive
                than Earth's, with a value of 3.69 m/s². The average surface temperature is -50°C, with temperatures
                ranging from -130°C to +30°C, making life potentially possible. Mars and Earth are about 4.5 billion years old,
                formed around the same time.
