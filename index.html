            <h2 id="Mercury">Planet Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the first and innermost planet in the solar system.
                Its distance to the sun is about 60,000,000 km, which means that
                the sun's light takes about three minutes to reach Mercury.
                Because of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is difficult to see with a telescope.
                Mercury revolves around the sun once in 88 days, four times as fast as Earth.
                It takes 176 days for Mercury to complete one complete rotation.
                The nearest neighboring planet is Venus, which is between 77 and 221 million
                kilometers away, depending on the orbit. Neither moons nor planetary rings orbit Mercury.
                Since Mercury is almost vertical in its orbital plane, there are no seasons.
                The direction of rotation is orthogonal. As a rocky planet, Mercury
                has a mass of 3.301 ⋅ 10^23 kg, which is only 0.05 the mass of Earth.
                Nevertheless, due to its nature, Mercury is one of the earth-like planets in our solar system.
                Its atmosphere consists mainly of the chemical elements oxygen, sodium, hydrogen and helium.
                The most common elements on the surface are silicon, iron and nickel.
                The inside consists of an iron-nickel core. With a total area of ​​74,800,000 km², it is about
                three times the size of Russia and China. At 3.7m/s², gravity is significantly weaker than on our earth.
                The average surface temperature is 170°C. However, temperatures can vary enormously depending on
                which side of the planet faces the sun. At night the temperature cools down to -170°C, while during the day
                more than +425°C can be reached. This means that Mercury has the greatest temperature fluctuations of all the
                planets in the solar system. At 4.5 billion years old, Mercury and Earth formed at about the same time.

            <h2 id="Venus">Planet Venus</h2>
            <p>
                Venus is the second planet in the solar system. Its distance to the sun is
                about 110,000,000 km, which means that the sun's light takes about six minutes to reach Venus.
                After the moon, Venus is the brightest star in the starry sky and can therefore be easily observed with a telescope.
                On favorable days, Venus can even be seen with the naked eye. Venus revolves around
                the sun once in 243 days, which is about 100 days less than Earth needs for its year.
                It takes 116 days for Venus to complete one complete rotation. The nearest neighboring planet is Mercury,
                which is between 77 and 221 million kilometers away, depending on the orbit. Nevertheless,
                Venus is the planet that comes closest to Earth in its orbit. Neither moons nor planetary rings orbit Venus.
                Since Venus is practically not tilted in its orbital plane, there are no seasons.
                The direction of rotation is retrograde. As a rocky planet, Venus has a mass of 4.869 ⋅ 10^24 kg,
                which is 0.86 times the mass of Earth. Nevertheless, Venus is one of the earth-like planets in our
                solar system due to its composition. Your atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide.
                As the only rocky planet in the solar system, the atmosphere is permanently opaque.
                The exact composition of the chemical elements on the surface are unknown.
                The interior probably consists of an iron-nickel core. With a total area of ​​460,234,317 km²,
                it is roughly the size of Earth. At 8.87 m/s², gravity is also comparable to that of our earth.
                The average surface temperature is 470°C. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the
                year and vary between +430°C and +500°C. This rules out liquid water on Venus. With an age of 4.5 billion years,
                Venus and Earth formed at about the same time

            <p>
                Earth is the third planet in the solar system. Its distance from the sun is about 150,000,000 km,
                which means that the sun's light takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach us.
                The earth revolves around the sun once in 365.2 days. It takes 24 hours for the earth to 
                rotate completely around its axis of rotation. With a mean orbital velocity of 29.78 km/s,
                Earth is moving faster than Mars but slower than Mercury and Venus. The closest neighboring planets
                are Venus and Mars, the latter being between 56 and 401 million kilometers away, depending on the orbit.
                The moon orbits the earth as the only natural satellite at a distance of about 380,000 km and
                stabilizes the planet through its gravitation in its inclination to the earth's axis. On the other hand,
                there is no planetary ring. Because of its orbital plane inclined at 23.5° to the sun, there are seasons on earth.
                The direction of rotation is orthogonal. As a rocky planet, Earth has a mass of 5.97 ⋅ 10^24kg.
                Their atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The most common chemical elements on the surface are iron,
                oxygen and silicon. The interior consists of an iron-nickel core with an estimated maximum temperature of 5000°C.
                The earth is surrounded by a magnetic field with a strength of 25 to 65 microtesla, which protects its inhabitants
                from solar winds. With a total area of ​​510,000,000 km² and a diameter of 12742 km, the earth is about the size of Venus.
                Gravity is 9.8 m/s². The average surface temperature is 15°C. The temperatures measured to date vary
                between -89°C and +58°C. Earth is still the only known planet in the solar system and beyond on which life forms have
                been detected. The age of the earth is estimated at 4.6 billion years.

            <h2 id="Mars">Planet Mars</h2>
            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet in the solar system. Its distance from the sun is approximately 227.9 million km,
                so it takes about thirteen minutes for sunlight to reach Mars. After Venus and Jupiter,
                Mars is the third-brightest planet in the sky and can be easily observed with a telescope and, on clear nights,
                even with the naked eye due to its red appearance. Mars takes 687 days to orbit the sun, almost twice as long as Earth.
                It takes about 24 hours for Mars to complete one rotation on its axis. One day on Mars therefore lasts as
                long as one on Earth. Mars's neighboring planets are Earth and Jupiter, with the former ranging from 56 to
                401 million kilometers away, depending on its orbit. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, but no planet rings.
                Like Earth, Mars stands in its orbital plane, so there are seasons. Its direction of rotation is prograde.
                As a rocky planet, Mars has a mass of 6.419 × 10^23 kg, which is 0.1 times the mass of Earth. Despite this,
                Mars is classified as an Earth-like planet due to its characteristics. Its atmosphere consists of 96% carbon dioxide,
                2% nitrogen, and 2% argon. The most common chemical elements on the surface are iron, sulfur, and silicon.
                The interior consists of an iron core with an estimated maximum temperature of 2000°C. With a total surface
                area of 144.798.500 km², Mars is about eight times the size of Russia. The gravity is significantly less attractive
                than Earth's, with a value of 3.69 m/s². The average surface temperature is -50°C, with temperatures
                ranging from -130°C to +30°C, making life potentially possible. Mars and Earth are about 4.5 billion years old,
                formed around the same time.

            <h2 id="Jupiter">Planet Jupiter</h2>
            <p>
                Jupiter is the fifth planet in the solar system and is located between Mars and Saturn.
                Its distance from the sun is approximately 780,000,000 km, which means that it takes light from the sun
                about 44 minutes to reach Jupiter. After Venus and the moon, Jupiter is the third brightest celestial
                body in the night sky and can be easily observed with a telescope. It takes 11 years and 315 days for
                Jupiter to orbit the sun. It takes about 9 hours and 56 minutes for Jupiter to fully rotate on its axis.
                This means that a day on Jupiter is not even half as long as a day on Earth. There are a total of 79 moons
                orbiting Jupiter, but the so-called Galilean moons make up more than 99.9% of the mass of all Jupiter's
                moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Astronomers believe that these moons have frozen water in contrast to Jupiter.
                A weakly developed system of rings surrounds the planet. The rings are made up of dust from Jupiter's moons that
                have been struck by other celestial bodies. Because Jupiter is tilted at only 3.12° in its orbital plane,
                there are no seasons. Its rotation direction is prograde. As a gas planet, Jupiter has a mass of 1.899 x 10^27 kg,
                which is equivalent to 317 Earth masses. Its atmosphere contains sulfur and phosphorus, among other things.
                The exact composition is still unknown. The interior is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium. It is believed
                that Jupiter has a rocky core. With a total surface area of 61,418,738,571 km² and a diameter of 139,822 km,
                Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Its gravity is significantly stronger than Earth's at 24.79 m/s².
                The average surface temperature is -100°C. The highest and lowest temperatures are unknown.
                Jupiter and Earth are about the same age, about 4.5 billion years old.

            <p>
                Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system and is located between Jupiter and Uranus.
                Its distance from the sun is approximately 1.5 billion km, which means that it takes light from the
                sun about 80 minutes to reach Saturn. As the outermost planet in the solar system that is still visible
                to the naked eye, Saturn has been observed by humans for thousands of years. It takes 29 years and 166 days
                for Saturn to orbit the sun. It takes about 10 hours and 39 minutes for Saturn to fully rotate on its axis.
                This means that a day on Saturn is not even half as long as a day on Earth. There are a total of 82 moons orbiting
                Saturn, including the well-known Saturn moon, Titan. As an ice moon, Titan has significant amounts of frozen water.
                It is possible that Saturn has more moons that have not yet been discovered through telescopes.
                A strongly developed system of rings surrounds the planet and gives it its characteristic trademark.
                The rings are made of dust and ice. Scientists believe that the particles may come from a former Saturn moon.
                The rotation direction is prograde. As a gas planet, Saturn has a mass of 5.685 x 10^26 kg, which is equivalent
                to 95 Earth masses. Its atmosphere is mainly composed of hydrogen (96%) and small amounts of helium (3%).
                The core of Saturn is made up of an ice-rock mixture. With a total surface area of 42.7 billion km² and a diameter
                of 116,464 km, Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system. Its gravity is about the same
                as Earth's at 10.44 m/s². The average surface temperature is -140°C. The enormous pressure in the planet's core
                results in temperatures of over 11,000°C. Saturn and Earth are about the same age, about 4.5 billion years old.

            <h2 id="Uranus">Planet Uranus</h2>
            <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet in the solar system and is located between Saturn and Neptune.
                Its distance from the sun is approximately 3 billion km, which means that it takes light from the sun
                about 160 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus is rarely visible to the naked eye under optimal conditions.
                It takes 84 years for Uranus to orbit the sun, and it takes approximately 17 hours and 14 minutes for
                Uranus to complete one full rotation on its axis. Uranus has 27 moons orbiting it.
                It also has at least 13 rings surrounding it, which are mostly made up of dust and rock.
                Scientists suspect that the particles in these rings may come from one or more of Uranus' moons that
                were brought into Uranus' orbit after a collision. Uranus rotates in the opposite direction of most other planets.
                As a gas planet, Uranus has a mass of 8.683 x 10^25 kg, which is equivalent to 14 Earth masses.
                Its atmosphere is made up of 80% hydrogen, 15% helium, and small amounts of methane (2%).
                It is actually the methane gas, rather than water, that gives Uranus its blue color.
                Methane absorbs red wavelengths of light and reflects blue wavelengths. Uranus has a core made of a mixture of ice,
                rock, and a mantle of water, methane ice, and ammonia. With a total surface area of 8 billion km² and a
                diameter of 50,724 km, Uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system. Its gravity, at 8.87 m/s²,
                is similar to that of Earth. The average surface temperature of Uranus is -200°C. However,
                the pressure at the core of the planet is so high that temperatures reach over 11,000°C.
                Uranus and Earth are approximately the same age, at 4.5 billion years old.

            <h2 id="Neptune">Planet Neptun</h2>
            <p>
                The Neptune is the eighth and outermost planet in the solar system.
                Its distance from the sun is approximately 4.5 billion kilometers, which means it takes light
                from the sun about 250 minutes to reach Neptune. Neptune is not visible to the naked eye from Earth.
                It takes 164 years for Neptune to orbit the sun, making it the slowest orbiting planet in the solar system.
                It takes about 16 hours and 6 minutes for Neptune to complete one rotation on its axis.
                There are 14 moons orbiting Neptune, with the 14th moon, Hippocamp, being discovered in 2013.
                Neptune has at least one ring system consisting mostly of fine dust and rock particles,
                which are believed to have resulted from collisions of Neptune's moons that were then pulled into
                orbit around the planet. Neptune's rotation is clockwise. Because of its axial tilt of 29.58 degrees,
                Neptune has seasons, but because of its slow orbit, these seasons are much longer than on Earth.
                As a gas planet, Neptune has a mass of 1.0243 x 10^26 kilograms, or about 17 Earth masses.
                Its atmosphere is similar to that of Uranus, consisting of hydrogen (80%), helium (19%),
                and small amounts of methane (1%). It is the methane gas, not water, that gives Neptune its blue color
                by absorbing incoming red light. Neptune's core is a mixture of ice and rock, surrounded by a mixture of water,
                methane ice, and ammonia. With a total surface area of 7,618,272,763 square kilometers and a
                diameter of 49,244 kilometers, Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the solar system.
                Its gravitational force is 11.15 m/s², slightly stronger than that of Earth. The average surface temperature
                of Neptune is -200°C, but due to the immense pressure, temperatures near its core can reach over 8,000°C.
                Neptune is approximately 4.5 billion years old, the same age as Earth.
